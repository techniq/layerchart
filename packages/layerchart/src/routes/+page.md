<h1>Welcome to LayerChart</h1>

LayerChart is a large collection of visualization components and utilities for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), built upon the wonderful [Layer Cake](https://layercake.graphics/) framework.

The goal is to provide a collection of useful but mostly unopinionated components as building blocks for a wide range of visualizations, such as:

- Cartesian (Bar, Area, Stack, Scatter, ...)
- Radial (Pie, Arc, Sunburst, ...)
- Hierarchy (Pack, Tree, Treemap, Sunburst, ...)
- Graph (Sankey, ...)
- Geo (Choropleth, Spike, Bubble, Point, Globe, ...)

The library accomplishes this through a large assortment of components:

- Data-driven components (Area, Bars, Spline, ...)
- Motion-enabled SVG primatives (Rect, Circle, Arc, Group, ...)
- SVG utilities (gradient/patterns, clipping, multi-line SVG text, motion path, ...)
- Interaction (tooltip, pan/zoom)
- Hierarchy layout and geo projections
- Legends, annotations, and many more!
