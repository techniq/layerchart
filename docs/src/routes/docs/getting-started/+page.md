# Getting Started

LayerChart can be used standlone on a new project, or integrates with many popular styling and component frameworks.

First class support for Tailwind styling is built in, but the library also works using only CSS and direct styles.

- [Svelte UX](https://github.com/techniq/layerchart/tree/docs-v2/examples/svelte-ux-2)
